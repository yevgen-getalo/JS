This module enables to use a BDD-style approach for cross-browser testing:
- Describe user stories in [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) using [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference)
- Map them to browser operations and assertions in [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/)
- Run using either real browser, headless browser or cloud based [WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) services such as [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) or [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)

This plugin allows to run tests in two modes:
- Nightwatch.js as runner (default)
- Cucumber.js as runner

## Installation

### Step 1

First you need to have Nightwatch.js and Cucumber.js to be installed locally.

```
$ npm install --save-dev nightwatch cucumber
```

If you are new to Nightwatch.js you can read the [developer guide](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide).

### Step 2

Install `nightwatch-cucumber`

```
$ npm install --save-dev nightwatch-cucumber
```

### Step 3

In project root create a JavaScript configuration file for Nightwatch.js. Use `nightwatch.conf.js` instead of `nightwatch.json`. [More details](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#settings-file)
```
// nightwatch.conf.js

module.exports = {
  ...
}
```

### Step 4

Add `nightwatch-cucumber` to `src_folders` in configuration file.
```
// nightwatch.conf.js

var nightwatchCucumber = require('nightwatch-cucumber')({
  /* configuration */
})

module.exports = {
  src_folders: [nightwatchCucumber],
  ...
}
```
For more examples check out the [test folder](https://github.com/mucsi96/nightwatch-cucumber/tree/master/test)

## Demo Test
By default feature files are located in `features` folder. You can change this using configuration object.

```
# features/google.feature

Feature: Google Search

Scenario: Searching Google

  Given I open Google's search page
  Then the title is "Google"
  And the Google search form exists
```

Step definitions files are located in `features/step_definitions` folder by default.

All step definitions will run with `this` set to Nightwatch.js client or browser object

```
// features/step_definitions/google.js

module.exports = function() {

  this.Given(/^I open Google's search page$/, function() {
    this
      .url('http://google.com')
      .waitForElementVisible('body', 1000)
  })

  this.Then(/^the title is "([^"]*)"$/, function(title) {
    this.assert.title(title)
  })

  this.Then(/^the Google search form exists$/, function() {
    this.assert.visible('input[name="q"]')
  })

}
```

For more examples check out the [test folder](https://github.com/mucsi96/nightwatch-cucumber/tree/master/test)

## Running tests

If you have installed `nightwatch` with `-g` (global) option you can run the tests by executing
```
nightwatch
```

In other case you can run the tests by executing
```
node_modules/.bin/nightwatch
```

## Features

### HTML reports

HTML report generation is enabled by default. It's default location is `reports/index.html`. You can disable or change this using configuration object.

![alt-tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mucsi96/nightwatch-cucumber/master/img/cucumber-html-report.png)

### Feature background
You can use feature background to avoid copying and pasting of steps. The background runs before each scenario after beforeScenario hooks.

```
Feature: Feature background example

Background:
  Given there are 10 cucumbers

Scenario: eating

  When I eat 3 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

Scenario: adding

  When I add 1 cucumbers
  Then I should have 11 cucumbers
```

### Scenario Outlines
You can use scenario outlines to avoid copying and pasting of scenarios.

```
Scenario Outline: eating
  Given there are <start> cucumbers
  When I eat <eat> cucumbers
  Then I should have <left> cucumbers

  Examples:
  | start | eat | left |
  |  12   |  5  |  7   |
  |  20   |  5  |  15  |
```

### Page Objects
For making you tests more readable and maintainable you can use the Page Object pattern. Nightwatch reads the page objects from the folder (or folders) specified in the `page_objects_path` configuration property. [More details](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#page-objects). Add the following line to Nightwatch.js configuration file.

```
// nightwatch.conf.js

var nightwatchCucumber = require('nightwatch-cucumber')({
  /* configuration */
})

module.exports = {
  src_folders: [nightwatchCucumber],
  page_objects_path: 'page-objects',
  ...
}
```

```
//page-objects/yahoo.js

module.exports = {
  url: 'http://yahoo.com',
  elements: {
    body: 'body',
    searchBar: 'input[name="p"]'
  }
}
```

Now we can use page objects from step definitions

```
//step-definitions/yahoo.js

module.exports = function() {

  this.Given(/^I open Yahoo's search page$/, function() {
    var yahoo = this.page.yahoo()

    yahoo
      .navigate()
      .waitForElementVisible('@body', 1000)
  })

  this.Then(/^the Yahoo search form exists$/, function() {
    var yahoo = this.page.yahoo()

    yahoo.assert.visible('@searchBar')
  })

}
```

### Feature Groups
You can selectively run features based on groups. To group features together just place them in the same sub-folder. The folder name is the name of the group.
You can use Nightwatch CLI `--group`, `--skipgroup` flags. [More details ](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#test-groups)

### Feature Tags
You can selectively run features based on tags. [More details ](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#test-tags)
```
# google.feature

@google @search
Feature: Google Search

Scenario: Searching Google

  Given I open Google's search page
  Then the title is "Google"
  And the Google search form exists
```
```
$ node nightwatch.js --tag google
```
You can also skip features based on tags
```
node nightwatch.js --skiptags google
```

### Hooks

#### Before/after all features and before/after each feature
These hooks can be provided using Nightwatch external globals. External globals file is specified in the `globals_path` property of `nightwatch.conf.js`. [More details](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#external-globals)

```
// nightwatch.conf.js

var nightwatchCucumber = require('nightwatch-cucumber')({
  /* configuration */
})

module.exports = {
  src_folders: [nightwatchCucumber],
  globals_path: 'globals-module.js',
  ...
}
```

```
// globals-module.js

module.exports = {
  before : function(cb) {
    console.log('Runs before all features')
    cb()
  },

  beforeEach : function(browser, cb) {
    console.log('Runs before each feature')
    cb()
  },

  after : function(cb) {
    console.log('Runs after all features')
    cb()
  },

  afterEach : function(browser, cb) {
    console.log('Runs after each feature')
    cb()
  }
}

```

#### Before/after each scenario and before/after each step
These hooks can be provided using configuration object.

```
// nightwatch.conf.js

var nightwatchCucumber = require('nightwatch-cucumber')({
  beforeScenario: function(browser, cb) {
    console.log('Runs before each scenario')
    cb()
  },
  beforeStep: function(browser) {
    console.log('Runs before each step')
  },
  afterScenario: function(browser, cb) {
    console.log('Runs after each scenario')
    cb()
  },
  afterStep: function(browser) {
    console.log('Runs after each step')
  }
})

module.exports = {
  src_folders: [nightwatchCucumber],
  ...
}
```

### Closing Selenium session

This plugin provides three ways of closing Selenium sessions. This enables reuse of session and prevents browser restarts. This can be controlled in configuration using `closeSession` property. Possible values are:
- `afterScenario`
- `afterFeature` default
- `never`

## Configuration

The default configuration object is.
```
{
  runner: 'nightwatch',
  featureFiles: 'features',
  stepDefinitions: 'features/step_definitions',
  closeSession: 'afterFeature',
  htmlReport: 'reports/index.html'
}
```

Default configuration could be overwritten in the following way.
```
// nightwatch.conf.js

var nightwatchCucumber = require('nightwatch-cucumber')({
  runner: 'cucumber'
})

module.exports = {
  src_folders: [nightwatchCucumber],
  ...
}
```
# Cucumber.js as runner

## Installation

### Step 1

First you need to have Nightwatch.js and Cucumber.js to be installed locally.

```
$ npm install --save-dev nightwatch cucumber
```

If you are new to Nightwatch.js you can read the [developer guide](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide).

### Step 2

Install `nightwatch-cucumber`

```
$ npm install --save-dev nightwatch-cucumber
```

### Step 3

In project root create a configuration file for Cucumber.js. [More details](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js#profiles)

```
// cucumber.js

var nightwatchCucumber = require('nightwatch-cucumber')({
  /* configuration */
  runner: 'cucumber'
})

module.exports = {
  default: '--require ' + nightwatchCucumber + ' --require features'
}
```
### Step 4

In project root create a JavaScript configuration file for Nightwatch.js. Use `nightwatch.conf.js` instead of `nightwatch.json`. [More details](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#settings-file)
```
// nightwatch.conf.js

module.exports = {
  ...
}
```
For examples check out the [test folder](https://github.com/mucsi96/nightwatch-cucumber/tree/master/test)

## Running tests

If you have installed `cucumber` with `-g` (global) option you can run the tests by executing
```
cucumberjs
```

In other case you can run the tests by executing
```
node_modules/.bin/cucumberjs
```
